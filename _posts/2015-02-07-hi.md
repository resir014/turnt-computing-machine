My name is Mel, and at the writing of this post I am a 19-years-old, amateur programmer. This is my sort-of hobby and side thing, as I am not very good at coding. I am more of a software tester, tinkerer, etc.

So here's the thing. I have not programmed anything legitimately in over a year and a half, and - it goes without saying - it has been detrimental to my skill set. But there is a solution to (almost) every problem, right? And that is to <b>start coding</b>!

So, let me re-introduce myself.... Hi. My name is Mel , and today I start my disorganised mess to re-learn what was forgotten, and expand my knowledge further! (Not to mention improving my writing skills because wow, this is atrocious.)
