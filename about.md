[this is filler text, please ignore]

i was adobted into the socially excluded edm life that is known as softcore dance music in the stylistic influence of electro house (aka deadmaufive the god of all electronic music (notice how i didnt say electronic dance music as that would count as aggravated assault against our lord and savior joel zimmerman)) located in the midst of northern arizona in which the demonic snow wizard rests in his home to dread us with the white, frozen water crystals that gently and gracefully dance down from the skies above onto our rooftops and streets just to piss us off in the waking mornings because half of us still dont know how to drive in such weather.
